# Simple-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Simulates single-asset and portfolio outcomes over multiple years using historical stock data, calculates risk metrics, and visualizes results with ggplot2 in R.


This project demonstrates a Monte Carlo simulation for a single stock, using historical price data to estimate potential portfolio outcomes over a multi-year horizon. It showcases the integration of financial modeling, risk analysis, and data visualization using R.

The purpose of this project is to highlight skills in both Management Information Systems (MIS) and Finance, including:

- Using historical financial data to estimate expected return (μ) and volatility (σ).

- Applying Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for Monte Carlo simulations.

- Assessing asset risk, including probability of loss.

- Visualizing results for clear interpretation.
